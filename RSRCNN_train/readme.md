ILSVRC2015: the dataset downloaded from ImageNet is used to train residual image super-resolution CNN 

generate_train.m: for generating the LR/HR pairs for training RSRCNN

RESRCNN_model: the pre-trained model of RSRCNN

RSRCNN is based on [1] and [2] to implement three layers of residual image super-resolution convolutional neural network.
